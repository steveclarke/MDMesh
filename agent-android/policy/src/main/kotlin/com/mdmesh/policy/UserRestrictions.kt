/**
 * Pure, side-effect-free mapping from a capability key to the

 * the minimum SDK at which that restriction set becomes meaningful.
 *
 * Splitting this out of the (DPM-touching) strategies makes the *decision* —
 * which restrictions, and whether this SDK supports them — independently unit
 * testable on the JVM. The strategies just call [forKey] and add/clear the
 * returned set; they hold no policy knowledge themselves.
 *
 * Restriction key strings are duplicated as literals (rather than referencing the
 * `UserManager.DISALLOW_*` constants) so this file carries no Android dependency
 * and runs under a plain JVM test. The values are part of the stable Android API.
